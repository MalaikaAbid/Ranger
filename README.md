Ranger is a navigation device that gives audio directions to a room you are trying to get to in the Schulich School of Engineering Building. Ranger’s purpose is to help visitors or new students find rooms and spaces faster. 
Ranger was designed as a final project for the Integrated Learning Stream from the department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Calgary. The goal of the project is to combine knowledge and experience from all the courses of the second semester of the UofC Electrical Engineering program. 

Ranger design team received valuable feedback from ILS - ENEL instructors and students, during Alpha and Beta testing and throughout the time we spent working on the project. In addition to that we asked events coordinator at the Schulich School of Engineering, Ivana D’Adamo for feedback, since her perspective is very important in terms of our project. We also conducted an quick experiment. 
During Alpha testing the student feedback we received was that they saw our project as helpful. One of the students mentioned that he would have used Ranger when he first started studying at the Schulich School of Engineering as an international student, and Ranger would make it a lot easier for him to become familiar with the building and get faster to classes. There also was an idea proposal from other students to use LCD screen that is a part of PCB along with PIC Microprocessor, however we did not proceed with that idea. 
During Beta testing the feedback we received was to make our pitch longer and speak positively about the project. We could plan for a longer demo of Ranger as well as have user manual and project documentation in physical form, not digital. We also received great pointers of what to include in our pitch to sound more professional and persuasive. 
Ivana D’Adamo told us that Ranger would be very useful in the Engineering building. When she invites guest speakers and other visitors she can give them directions to the closest parking lot and how to get to the building from parking lot, but she does not have a reliable way to directing them to the space or room an event will be held at, so Ranger would be great at helping with guiding people in the building. Ivana also mentioned that she would like to have another Ranger not only at the main entrance to the building but also at the ICT link. 
For the experiment we asked people not familiar with the engineering building to find rooms and spaces in the building first without audio directions and then with the help of audio directions. WIth no directions 3 visitors found ENGG Lounge in 3 minutes starting at the main entrance to the building. With audio directions they were able to find ENC 70 in only only 1 minute, they also used a phone to record the directions because they wanted to have an option of using the directions on the go. Judging from this data, we were able to observe how helpful Ranger is and that it fulfills its purpose of helping people to find needed rooms in shorter amount of time. 


Over the last few weeks, our team has worked tirelessly to bring this product to life. Here's a chart to show how many hours we worked:

Emilia designed a high-pass filter that was customized to the human voice, Alaa took charge of the hardware, and Malaika wrote all the code. The PIC microprocessor wasn't the easiest microprocessor to work with, and coupled with the matrix keypad, we had a real challlenge on our hands. But together we managed to overcome all the obstacles.
