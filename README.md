# Ranger

## Team Members: Malaika Abid, Emilia Konoeva, and Alaa Khalil
Ranger is a navigation device that gives audio directions to a room you are trying to get to in the Schulich School of Engineering Building. Rangerâ€™s purpose is to help visitors or new students find rooms and spaces faster. 
Ranger was designed as a final project for the Integrated Learning Stream from the department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Calgary. The goal of the project is to combine knowledge and experience from all the courses of the second semester of the UofC Electrical Engineering program. 

Over the last few weeks, our team has worked tirelessly to bring this product to life. Here's a chart to show how many hours we worked:

Emilia designed a high-pass filter that was customized to the human voice, Alaa took charge of the hardware, and Malaika wrote all the code. The PIC microprocessor wasn't the easieset microprocessor to work with, and coupled with the matrix keypad, we had a real challlenge on our hands. But together we managed to overcome all the obstacles.
