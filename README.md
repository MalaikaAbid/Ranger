# Ranger

Ranger is a navigation device that gives audio directions to a room you are trying to get to in the Schulich School of Engineering Building. Ranger’s purpose is to help visitors or new students find rooms and spaces faster. 
Ranger was designed as a final project for the Integrated Learning Stream from the department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Calgary. The goal of the project is to combine knowledge and experience from all the courses of the second semester of the UofC Electrical Engineering program. 

To use it:

Step 1: Find the room you are looking for on the table below.
Step 2: Press the corresponding button on the keypad to hear audio directions.
